#+TITLE: voices-in-my-head

Tooling for curating contextual voices. Context is anything you are working on
or thinking about. Voices are the telegraphic inner speech that drive your works
or thoughts.

=vimh= is an experimentation in expressing inner speech for people inclining
towards the verbal modality of thinking.

The way I personally create something ties up very little of what I do while
creating that piece. This covers both prose and programs. What I want to also
keep is a sort of memory of the process. One naive way is to just keep screen
recording the whole process. But that is /naive/ because of many reasons. With
vimh, I want to rethink what happens on a keypress and save more than characters
while working.
