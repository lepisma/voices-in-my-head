#+TITLE: voices-in-my-head

Tooling for curating contextual voices. Context is anything you are working on
or thinking about. Voices are the telegraphic inner speech that drive your works
or thoughts.

=vimh= is an experimentation in expressing inner speech for people inclining
towards the verbal modality of thinking.

The process of creating something is usually lost in the end product. This
covers both prose and programs. What I want is to keep a sort of memory of this
process. A naive way is to just keep screen recording the whole time. But that
is /naive/ because of many reasons. With vimh, I want to rethink what happens on a
keypress and save more than characters while working.
